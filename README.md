# Invoice Generator

Automated invoice generation system that analyzes git commits and sends configurable invoices on custom schedules.

## Features

- üìä Analyzes git commits across multiple repositories
- üìß Sends formatted HTML emails via Gmail
- üóìÔ∏è Flexible scheduling (bi-weekly, weekly, monthly, custom)
- üéØ Multi-client support with configuration files
- üß™ Test mode for safe testing
- üìù Categorizes work based on commit messages
- ‚è∞ Configurable hours per week per client

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up Gmail credentials:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
# Edit .env with your Gmail app password
```

3. Build the TypeScript files:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Install globally (optional):
```bash
./install-global.sh
```

## Configuration

The system uses a `invoice-configs.json` file to manage multiple invoice configurations.

### Configuration File Format

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "global": {
    "defaultFromEmail": "your@email.com",
    "defaultBcc": ["your@email.com"]
  },
  "invoices": [
    {
      "id": "client-biweekly",
      "name": "Client Name Bi-Weekly Invoice",
      "customer": "ClientName",
      "enabled": true,
      "schedule": {
        "type": "bi-weekly-sunday",
        "startDate": "2024-09-15"
      },
      "email": {
        "to": ["client@example.com"],
        "cc": ["manager@example.com"],
        "bcc": ["your@email.com"],
        "subject": "Invoice from {{startDate}} - {{endDate}}",
        "fromName": "Your Name"
      },
      "git": {
        "repos": ["/path/to/repos/*"],
        "weeks": 2,
        "hoursPerWeek": 30
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schedule Types

- **bi-weekly-sunday**: Every other Sunday (requires `startDate`)
- **weekly-sunday**: Every Sunday
- **monthly-first**: First day of each month
- **monthly-last**: Last day of each month
- **custom**: Custom cron expression (coming soon)

### Git Repository Patterns

Supports glob patterns for flexible repo matching:
- `/opt/dev/xferall*` - All directories starting with "xferall"
- `/opt/dev/client-*` - All directories matching pattern
- `/path/to/specific/repo` - Single repository

## Usage

### List Available Configurations

```bash
invoice
# or
invoice --list
```

### Generate Invoice from Config

```bash
# Generate and send invoice for a specific config
invoice xferall-biweekly

# Test mode (only sends to yourself)
invoice xferall-biweekly --test

# Dry run (generate but don't send)
invoice xferall-biweekly --dry-run

# Verbose output
invoice xferall-biweekly --verbose
```

### Legacy Command (Direct Customer Lookup)

```bash
# Still supported for backward compatibility
invoice legacy xferall
invoice legacy xferall --test
```

## Automated Scheduling

### Set Up Scheduler

The scheduler automatically runs all enabled invoices based on their schedules:

```bash
./setup-scheduler.sh
```

This creates a launchd job that runs every Sunday at 9:00 AM and checks which invoices should run that day.

### Manage Scheduler

```bash
# Check status
launchctl list | grep invoice

# Stop scheduler
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stokedconsulting.invoice-generator.plist

# Start scheduler
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.stokedconsulting.invoice-generator.plist

# View logs
tail -f scheduler.log
```

## Adding a New Client

1. Edit `invoice-configs.json`
2. Add a new invoice configuration:

```json
{
  "id": "newclient-monthly",
  "name": "New Client Monthly Invoice",
  "customer": "NewClient",
  "enabled": true,
  "schedule": {
    "type": "monthly-first"
  },
  "email": {
    "to": ["client@newclient.com"],
    "subject": "Monthly Invoice {{startDate}} - {{endDate}}"
  },
  "git": {
    "repos": ["/opt/dev/newclient*"],
    "weeks": 4,
    "hoursPerWeek": 40
  }
}
```

3. Test it:
```bash
invoice newclient-monthly --test --dry-run
```

4. Enable when ready - it will automatically run on schedule!

## Gmail Setup

1. Enable 2-factor authentication on your Google account
2. Generate an app password:
   - Go to https://myaccount.google.com/security
   - Click on "2-Step Verification"
   - Click on "App passwords"
   - Generate a new password for "Mail"
3. Add the password to `.env` file:
```
GMAIL_USER=your@email.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password-here
```

## Invoice Format

The invoice includes:
- Week-by-week breakdown
- Task categorization based on commit analysis
- Configurable hours per week
- HTML formatted email with professional styling

## Commit Analysis

The system categorizes commits into:
- Bug fixes and error resolution
- New feature development
- Code refactoring and optimization
- Testing and quality assurance
- Documentation updates
- UI/UX improvements
- Database and data management
- API development
- Deployment and DevOps
- Domain-specific categories (fax, dashboard, etc.)
- General development and maintenance

Hours are distributed proportionally based on commit activity in each category.

## Troubleshooting

### Email not sending
- Check `.env` file has correct Gmail app password
- Verify 2-factor authentication is enabled
- Check `scheduler-error.log` for errors

### Scheduler not running
- Verify launchd job is loaded: `launchctl list | grep invoice`
- Check logs in `scheduler.log` and `scheduler-error.log`
- Ensure Node.js path is correct in plist file

### No commits found
- Verify git repositories exist at configured paths
- Check glob patterns in config match your repos
- Run with `--verbose` flag for detailed output

### Config not found
- Verify `invoice-configs.json` exists in project root
- Check JSON is valid (no trailing commas, proper quotes)
- Ensure config ID matches exactly (case-sensitive)
